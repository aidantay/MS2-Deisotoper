MS2-Deisotoper is a tool that identifies monoisotopic peaks and removes isotopic peaks from centroided fragment ion spectra. 
To accomplish this, MS2-Deisotoper compares the mass and relative intensity of every peak to every other higher mass peak.

To download MS2-Deisotoper:

* Go to the Source page, click on the **Dist** link.
